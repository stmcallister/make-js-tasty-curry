# Make Your JS Functionally Tasty with Currying

*Abstract: Currying is a technique that has been part of mathematical functions for centuries, and is key component of functional programming. While currying is heavily used in functional languages like Haskell, it's not as prevalent in JavaScript. In this session we'll take what you know about functional JavaScript programming and pivot a bit to learn about the currying technique, how to use it in your code and, most importantly, why!*

# Functional Programming
**SHARP**: "As software becomes more and more complex, it is more and more important to structure it well. Well-structured software is easy to write and to debug, and provides a collection of modules that can be reused to reduce future programming costs."
*-- John Hughes, 
Why Functional Programming Matters

**POV**: We spend more time reading our code than writing, so let's make more readable code

**General CTA:** With your code in mind

# Currying

## What
- Named after Haskell Brooks Curry
- Haskell, Erlang, and.....JAVASCRIPT
- functional style of breaking down multi-argument functions into a series of nested single-argument functions.
- each function in the series returns a function
- this is possible because JS supports higher order functions and closures
- Currying and Partial Application

### Definitions
- **arity**: the number of arguments a function takes
- **higher-order functions**: A higher-order function is a function that takes one or more functions as arguments
- **closures**: combination of functions and the lexical environment within which a function is called
- **lexical scoping**: variable may come from the scope function was defined

- 

## How
- volume example
- price example



## Why
- take a function and derive a function that returns specialized functions
- "A programmer’s pipe-dream is to write code, and be able to use it repeatedly with little effort. It’s expressive because you write in a way that expresses what is needed, and it’s reuse because.. well, you’re reusing. What more could you want?" -- Hugh FD Jackson


- Little pieces can be configured and reused with ease, without clutter;
- Functions are used throughout.

**POV**: We spend more time reading our code than writing, so let's make more readable code
**Specific CTA**:
**Closing Sharp**:
